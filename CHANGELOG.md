1.8.5
--
- Made it so whenever permission is granted for players to modify resources, it also explicity includes the `Trusted Player` level.
- Added a patch on init that makes sure the "Trusted Player" permission level can modify resources whenever the regular Player level can.


1.8.4
--
- Fixed an issue where the Party Resources button would appear twice in the actors directory (this occurred mainly in pf2e, but should be fixed for other systems as well).
- Ukrainian language template was added through Weblate.


1.8.3
--
- Added a module setting to opt into a full width status bar. The default is "not full width".
- Added a module setting to align "not full width" status bars to the left, right, or center (default).
- Made it so full width status bars follows the above new setting's values, but for status bar contents, instead.
- Removed Settings Extender as a dependency in favour of Foundry's built in FilePicker (FINALLY! ðŸ˜‰).


1.8.2
--
- Removed some keys from the manifest that have been deprecated since v10. That should get rid of the warnings in v13's setup screen.
- Lowered the font-size of the text labels in the status bar slightly (1rem -> 0.9rem).
- Used `ui.actors.render()` instead of the now defunct `ActorDirectory.collection.render()`; this fixes the broken "change status bar location"-setting in v13.
- Fixed the chat textarea overlapping with the status bar when the sidebar is expanded with the chatbox visible.
- Fixed the broken image alignment of the "text below image"-setting in v13.
- Fixed a bunch of deprecation warnings related to major future Foundry versions (v15+).


1.8.1
--
In addition to the compatibility release, this is a bugfix release for v13:
* Fixed the broken "first time"-notification modal:
  * Fixed broken "Click here", which was due to `renderActorDirectory` no longer passing the `html` callback argument as an object.
  * Fixed the broken click trigger for the actors directory
  * Re-aligned the bouncing arrow to actually point to the height of the Party Resources button again.
* Fixed the distorted status bar:
  * Removed the `flexrow` class from the `li` elements.
  * Set `li > img` to display as inline blocks (was set to `block` in v13).
  * Removed the excess padding/margin accumulated since v11.
* Fixed the deprecation warnings for v14 caused by `mergeObject`, which will move to the `foundry.utils` namespace.

registered in game.settings.

all values that bugged out.

taken from the League of Foundry Developers' module template.

1.2.5
--
* Changed the compatibleCoreVersion setting to Foundry v9.

I want to use this space for anyone keeping up with the changes of this module
to state that the module is NOT abandoned. Covid-19 is having an affect on both 
my personal and professional life, so my time spent in and around D&D is 
limited. It is what it is, but I hope I can dedicate more time to D&D in 2022.
